            <h2>🐇 The Rabbit and The Tortoise 🐢</h2>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DHEqyi2.jpg" alt="Rabbit and Tortoise at the start">
            <p>
                Once upon a time, in a peaceful forest filled with sunshine and laughter, there lived a rabbit who was
                very proud of his speed.
                He would often boast, “I am the fastest animal in the forest!” and run around just to show off.
                The other animals admired his energy but were tired of his arrogance.
                Among them lived a wise and humble tortoise who moved slowly but never gave up.
                The rabbit laughed at him, calling him “Slowpoke.” The tortoise just smiled and said, “Let’s see about
                that someday.”
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="sec2" class="section">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4kNzkUf.jpg" alt="Rabbit laughing at tortoise">
            <p>
                One sunny morning, the tortoise challenged the rabbit to a race.
                The rabbit laughed loudly, “You must be joking!” he said.
                But the tortoise calmly replied, “We shall see who wins.”
                The forest animals gathered to watch the strange competition.
                The fox stood as the referee and shouted, “On your marks, get set, go!”
                The rabbit dashed off like lightning, while the tortoise began to move slowly and steadily, one step at
                a time.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="sec3" class="section">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gZzM2Yh.jpg" alt="Rabbit sleeping under tree">
            <p>
                Confident of victory, the rabbit decided to rest under a shady tree.
                “I’ll nap for a while and still beat that slow tortoise,” he thought proudly.
                The gentle breeze made him sleepy, and soon he was snoring softly.
                Meanwhile, the tortoise continued his slow journey — steady, patient, never stopping.
                The sun began to sink low in the sky as the tortoise quietly passed the sleeping rabbit, step by step,
                toward the finish line.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="sec4" class="section">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/f6VE8Cn.jpg" alt="Tortoise wins the race">
            <p>
                When the rabbit woke up, he saw the tortoise near the finish line!
                Terrified, he ran as fast as he could, but it was too late.
                The tortoise crossed the line just as the rabbit arrived, panting and ashamed.
                The forest erupted in cheers for the tortoise’s victory.
                The rabbit hung his head, realizing that his arrogance had cost him dearly.
                The tortoise smiled kindly and said, “Slow and steady wins the race.”
                From that day, every creature remembered the lesson of patience and perseverance.

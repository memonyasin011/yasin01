            <p>
                Once upon a time, in a lush green forest filled with singing birds and whispering trees, there lived a
                proud rabbit who was known far and wide for his incredible speed.
                Every day, he would boast to the other animals about how fast he could run. He loved showing off and
                teasing those who couldn’t keep up.
                Among the forest animals was a gentle tortoise who moved slowly but steadily, always calm and patient.
                The rabbit often laughed at him, saying, “You’re so slow! You’ll never get anywhere on time.”
                The tortoise would just smile and continue walking at his steady pace, never letting the rabbit’s
                teasing bother him.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <div id="part2" class="story-part">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4kNzkUf.jpg" alt="Rabbit laughing at tortoise">
            <p>
                One sunny morning, tired of being mocked, the tortoise finally decided to speak up. He said to the
                rabbit, “You may be fast, but I can still beat you in a race.”
                The rabbit burst into laughter. “You? Beat me? That’s impossible!” he said between giggles.
                The tortoise simply nodded and replied, “We’ll see. Let’s race tomorrow from this tree to the
                riverbank.”
                The news of the race spread quickly, and soon, all the animals gathered to watch.
                The fox agreed to act as the referee, and when he shouted, “Ready, set, go!” the rabbit shot forward
                like an arrow, leaving the tortoise far behind.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <div id="part3" class="story-part">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gZzM2Yh.jpg" alt="Rabbit running fast">
            <p>
                After running a great distance, the rabbit stopped and looked back. The tortoise was barely visible,
                slowly moving along the path.
                Feeling confident, the rabbit decided to rest under a shady tree. “The tortoise will take forever to get
                here,” he thought.
                He lay down, closed his eyes, and soon fell asleep. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept walking — one slow step
                after another — never stopping, never giving up.
                The sun began to set, and the forest turned golden, but the tortoise kept going, inch by inch, until he
                quietly passed the sleeping rabbit and moved toward the finish line.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
        <div id="part4" class="story-part">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/f6VE8Cn.jpg" alt="Tortoise wins the race">
            <p>
                When the rabbit finally woke up, the sun was low, and he panicked. He ran as fast as his legs could
                carry him, dust flying behind him — but it was too late.
                The tortoise was already at the finish line, greeted by cheers from the other animals.
                The rabbit hung his head in shame, realizing his arrogance had cost him the race.
                The tortoise smiled kindly and said, “Slow and steady wins the race.”
                From that day on, the rabbit learned to be humble, and the tortoise became a hero in the forest — a
                living reminder that patience, determination, and persistence are often stronger than speed and pride.
